# Ascertaining Mortality Risk within counterfactual models: Puerto Rico and Hurricane Mar√≠a
## Introduction 
This website includes the data and code neccesary to replicate our analysis contained in response to the paper [**"Differential and persistent risk of excess mortality from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico: a time-series analysis"**](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpla/article/PIIS2542-5196(18)30209-2/fulltext) which was published in [Lancet-Planetary Health](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/issue/current). 

## Content
This repository includes the following:

* [R code to produce the figures and meta-descriptive analysis discussed in our Letter](Commentary_Code_R_Repository.R)
* [Data used to Produce Figure 1 - Panel A](figure_1.csv)
* [Data used to produce Figure 1 - Panel B](figure_1_b.csv)
* Data for the descriptive analysis (meta-analysis) is the same as for Figure 1 - Panel B

## Figure 1

We also must ask ourselves whether the pre-Hurricane period behaved similarly to the historical trends. In this Supplementary Panel, we present the confidence intervals for January-August 2010-2016 and the corresponding total for 2017. As it can be appreciated in tis figure, the pre-Hurricane Maria period had 19,542 deaths which fall within the margins of variation observed in the previous years of the decade. There is **no** reason to build a counterfactual that does not behaves as it did for the pre-Hurricane Maria period. 

The appropriate counterfactual should be one where the predicted value falls within the historical ranges of variation for the previous decade. 

## Previous Estimates
For Supplementary Panel A, we acccessed a variety of estimates of excess deaths. Here we are including links to each of these estimates, which are compiled in the data file used to produced [Panel B](figure_1_b.csv).
